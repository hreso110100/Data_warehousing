**How to scrap data:**

**1.** src/config - contains config.yml where you can setup what data you want to scrap

**2.** Run Main.py to start scrapping(all data will be stored to data folder to csv file, HTML page will be also downloaded and saved to html_tables folder)

**ADDITIONAL INFO:** 

1. EPC page sometimes freezes so script will fail to complete scrapping

2. It takes 10 second to switch between pagination(it is because of slow loading)

3. Saving data can sometimes be slow, because of the amount of data
